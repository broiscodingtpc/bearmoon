üß∏ Token Name: $MOONBEAR
Chain: Solana
Mascot: A 3D ultra-detailed bear in an astronaut suit
Theme: Exploration, moon missions, degen crypto hustle

üêæ Project Description
$MOONBEAR is a meme-fueled, moon-bound mission on Solana.
Led by a fearless astronaut bear, this token represents every degen dreamer who strapped into the rocket and said "F it, we moon."
No roadmap ‚Äî just a space suit, diamond hands, and a one-way ticket to orbit.
The token is built for community-driven hype, fast growth, and interstellar memes.

We don't launch ‚Äî we lift off.

üß† Lore
In the year 2025, when the markets were cold and hope was low, a lone bear suited up and said "I've had enough."
Born in the depths of the Solana blockchain, MOONBEAR was once a joke... until he started building rockets to the moon.
Now, he floats above FUD, scans charts from orbit, and drops meme bombs on Earth from the stars.
He doesn't hibernate ‚Äî he dominates.
